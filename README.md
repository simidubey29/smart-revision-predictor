## What Problem Does This Solve?
When we study something:
We forget over time
We don’t know when to revise
We revise either too late or too often

This app predicts after how many days you should revise a topic based on simple inputs.

## What This Project Does

Takes study details as input
Uses a Machine Learning model

Predicts:
After how many days you should revise
Shows results in a simple and visual way

## Tech Stack Used
Python
Pandas & NumPy
Scikit-learn (ML model)
Streamlit (UI)

## Dataset Used
A simple  dataset containing:
Study time (hours)
Difficulty level (Easy / Medium / Hard)
Days since last study
Revision needed (Yes / No)

** Dataset is self-created for learning purposes.

## Machine Learning Model
Type: Classification / Regression (simple)
Purpose: Predict revision timing

**Steps included:
Data loading
Feature selection
Model training
Model evaluation
